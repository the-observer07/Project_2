<h1>Forex, Commodities, Crypto and More!</h1>

This project was created to aggregate data from various platforms. 
Why use multiple websites when you can just use one?

This project contains components that will allow you to retrieve live data which is used for trading.

You'll be able to access data on commodities, forex and the top 100 crypto tokens which are being traded.


This project is written in React js.

The packages that you'll need to have to run this project are:

- node.js
[Dropdownlist widget](https://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/docs/DropdownList/)
[React bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)
[Ticker](https://github.com/jeremyrajan/nice-react-ticker)

This is still a work in progress, feel free to chip in on it!
